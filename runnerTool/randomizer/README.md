# Carla Scenario Randomizer

## Overview
The Carla Scenario Randomizer is a tool designed for the CARLA simulator, aimed at creating diverse and randomized driving scenarios.
The original scenarios can be generated by using the scenario editor and executed by the scneario runner.
The randomizer manipulates various aspects of a CARLA driving scenario, such as target speeds, vehicle performances, spawn points, routes, datetime settings,
and weather conditions.

## Features
- **Randomization of Absolute Target Speed:** Adjusts the target speed of vehicles.
- **Dynamic Performance Changes:** Alters vehicle performance parameters including max speed, acceleration, and deceleration.
- **Variable Spawn Points:** Modifies the spawn locations of vehicles.
- **Flexible Datetime Settings:** Changes the datetime settings to simulate different times of the day.
- **Route Customization:** Alters predefined routes for diversified path planning.
- **Weather Variation:** Enables the randomization of weather conditions.

## Installation
- The Carla simulator needs to be installed. 

## Usage
1. **Setting Up the Scenario:**
   - Create a new folder containing your original scenario (e.g. "MyScenario") in runnerTool/scenarios/ if not already existing 

2. **Running the Randomizer:**
   - In the config.py script:
     - Change the scenario folder with your folder including your .xosc file (e.g. "runnerTool/scenarios/MyScenario") 
     - Change the original scenario file name with the name of your original .xosc file (e.g. "original.xosc")
     - Adapt the number of random scenarios that will be generated.
     - Adapt the intensity levels.
   - Execute the script using Python: `python runnerTool/randomizer.py`.
   - The script will modify the original scenario based on the configurations set in the `config.py` dictionary. For each intensity level, n random scenarios will be generated where n is equal to the number of random programs you defined in the config.

3. **Output:**
   - The modified scenario(s) will be saved in the same directory as the original file.

4. **Configuration**
   - The behavior of the randomizer can be controlled via the `config.py` dictionary in the script. Parameters include standard deviations and mean values for various elements like speed, performance, spawn points, and weather. The intensity level will be mutliplied with the standard deviations meaning for higher intensity level, values will be changed more extreme.

5. **Run Multiple Scenerios**
   - If you want to run multiple scenarios at once using the same config, you can execute run_multiple.py after you defined the dir where to look for the folders containing the original scenarios. Therefore adapt the variable `scenario_directory` in the top of the script.
