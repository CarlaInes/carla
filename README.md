# Scenario & Data Generation using CARLA

Welcome to our Traffic Scenario Suite for CARLA Simulator! This suite consists of several interconnected tools designed to enhance the CARLA simulator, allowing for robust scenario generation, automated data collection, and scenario randomization. Below, you'll find an overview of each tool with links to their dedicated README files for more detailed information.

## Tools Overview

### 1. Scenario Generation Tool

Our Scenario Generation Tool enables users to build detailed traffic scenarios. Tailored for versatility, it allows for the creation of complex driving environments to test and train autonomous driving systems.

### 2. Scenario Randomizer

The Scenario Randomizer takes an existing scenario as input and generates multiple new scenarios with slight, randomized variations. This tool is invaluable for testing the robustness of autonomous systems against a variety of conditions.

### 3 CARLA Scenario Runner

Integrated with the CARLA simulator, this tool allows for the execution of the scenarios created by our Scenario Generation Tool. It ensures seamless compatibility and execution within the CARLA environment.

### 4. Data Collection Tool

When running scenarios, our Data Collection Tool automatically gathers essential data, aiding in analysis and improvement of autonomous driving algorithms. It's designed to capture a wide range of scenario-specific data points.

- [SensorDataCollection](PythonAPI/SensorDataCollection/readme.md).



## Getting Started

To get started with our Traffic Scenario Suite, please refer to the individual READMEs for each tool and the official [Carla ReadMe](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla). It is important to install Carla, the ScnerioRunner and ScenarioEditor according to individual installation guides.
